 How TRUNCATE Works:
 
    Deletes all records from the table (like DELETE but faster).
    Resets auto-increment values (if the table has an AUTO_INCREMENT column).
    Cannot be rolled back (unlike DELETE).
    More efficient than DELETE (faster and uses less transaction log).

TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
